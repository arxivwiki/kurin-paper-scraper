# Note: no longer used

I wanted to take arXiv.wiki in a different direction so I no longer use this importer. It still works though.

Vitaly Kurin's paper notes to arXiv.wiki

Links to notes are here:

https://www.notion.so/Paper-Notes-by-Vitaly-Kurin-97827e14e5cd4183815cfe3a5ecf2f4c

This builds a list of arxiv urls paired with Kurin's notes page.

Runs with `npm start`. There should be a pre-existing file `pairs.txt` that will be updated by this script.
